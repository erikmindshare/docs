# AutoSurvey in one sentence
Build surveys, forms, and applications — deployed as **polished Salesforce Screen Flows**.

## Two ways to start
- **AI Prompt**: fastest wow
- **Google Sheets spec**: bulk editing + versioning

## What gets created in your org (at deploy)
- Native Screen Flow metadata
- Response object + fields
- Permissions / permission sets
- Page layout(s) (optional variant layouts for Matrix programs)

## Where it runs
Anywhere a Screen Flow runs:
- Behind login (internal users)
- Experience/portal users
- Public/unauthenticated patterns (when you choose that approach)
