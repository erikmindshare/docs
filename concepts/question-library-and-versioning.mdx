# Question Library & Versioning (stub)

## The pain
Surveys evolve. If every change means new fields, reports break and admin time explodes.

## What AutoSurvey provides
- Reusable question library concept
- Versioning across time
- Many surveys built from the same questions
- Safer iteration and comparison over time

> TODO: Add recommended keying strategy.
