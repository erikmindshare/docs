# Matrix Programs (Audience × Wave)

Define once, map to:
- Audiences (e.g., Member vs Supervisor)
- Waves/Rounds (e.g., Baseline, Month 3)

AutoSurvey generates a targeted Flow per combination.

Optional:
- Audience×Wave-specific page layouts (when enabled)

> TODO: Add naming conventions and examples.
