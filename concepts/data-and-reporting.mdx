# Data & Reporting
AutoSurvey is **Salesforce reporting-ready: fields for dashboards, answer records for analysis.**

## Dashboard fields
Best for operational reporting:
- Completion rate by audience
- KPIs and dashboards
- Simple filters and groupings

## Answer records
Best for analysis:
- Longitudinal trends over time
- Changing question sets without schema churn
- Drop-off analysis by screen/question

## Example: completion rate by audience
- Dashboard fields: group by Audience, chart % Completed using Status/Completed
- Answer records: still group by Audience, then analyze drop-off points and abandonment drivers

> TODO: Add example reports.
